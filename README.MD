# LeadIn Coding Assignment

1. This is a simple project to get Album data from the Spotify API. 'search' endpoint is used to fetch the data, in which user in input is sent as the query whereas the type is always 'album'.

2. Basic Javascript, Html and Css is used to develop this project, along with Bootstrap framework.

3. Features Implemented:
	- The user must be able to input a keyword that he wants to browse.
	- The user must be able to browse the thumbnails for that query in grid form.
	- It must display each album's artist name and title.
	- Upon clicking a thumbnail, the user must be able to view the higher resolution image associated to it.
	- The album browser should be usable on both desktop and mobile
	- Feature album sorting per artist name and per album title.
	- Display the higher resolution image on a layer on top of the grid.
	- Feature pagination for longer result sets.

	These are all the required and additional features.

4. Total working hours took around 5-6 hours of work. Since, no framework such as Angular.js etc. was used therefore the time to get help from the google is included in these hours. Other frameworks could have also been used but I chose to work on Vanilla JS as it was mentioned that the project can be done in JS.
